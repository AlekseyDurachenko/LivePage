# LivePage

LivePage is a developer tool which reloads website resources (such as CSS, HTML and JavaScript) as they change on the server, so you are always looking at the most up-to-date version of a web page. It can make developing websites a lot faster, by helping productivity. You can install LivePage via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh/details).

Key features are:
 * Entire domains can be made live
 * file:// protocol is now supported, though required "Allow access to file URLs" to be checked on the chrome extensions page.

It's recommended you use this extension only in a local development environment and not in a production environment.

## Running development version in Chrome

Clone this repo to your local machine. Then visit to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome. 

Within the Extension page, click "Load unpacked extension". A modal will popup with your local file system, navigate to where you cloned the repo to and click "Select".

## Roadmap

### 3.0.0

Version 3.0.0 will be primarily be aimed at making LivePage a better experience for non-english speakers. Here are they main stories I intend to do:

 * Simplify the english on the options pages.
 * Localise the options page
 * Add translations for Spanish, German, French & Russian. Initially this will just be the phrases put into Google Translate.
 ~* A new logo. I think I can come up with something the implies reloading more clearly.~
 * Update promotional images / videos. I really want to emphasise it simply polls for changes, but is simple to setup.
 * I'm going to look into ways of monetising via LivePage. I'm undecided whether this will be by asking for donations or making 3.0 a paid for version. Either way, all current users shouldn't have to pay.
