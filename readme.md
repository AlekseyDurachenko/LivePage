# LivePage

LivePage is a developer tool which reloads website resources (such as CSS, LESS, HTML and JavaScript) as they change on the server, so you are always looking at the most up-to-date version of a web page. It can make developing websites a lot faster, by helping productivity. You can install LivePage via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livepage/pilnojpmdoofaelbinaeodfpjheijkbh/details).

Key features are:
 * Entire domains can be made live
 * file:// protocol is now supported, though required "Allow access to file URLs" to be checked on the chrome extensions page.

It's recommended you use this extension only in a local development environment and not in a production environment. 

## Running development version in Chrome

Clone this repo to your local machine. Then visit to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome. 

Within the Extension page, click "Load unpacked extension". A modal will popup with your local file system, navigate to where you cloned the repo to and click "Select".
